- ⚡ Fun fact: The first computer programmer was a woman named Ada Lovelace, who wrote an algorithm for a mechanical computer called the Analytical Engine in the 1840s. Even though the machine was never built, her work is considered the first example of computer programming, making her a pioneer in the field long before modern computers even existed!
